AirBnB Clone - The Console Project
==================================

The first part in creating a copy of the airbnb clone website. https://www.airbnb.com/
The goal is to deploy on my own server a simple copy of the airbnb website.

INTRO:

The console is a command command line interpreter to manage object abstraction between objects and how they are stored
Created by the help of the cmd python module


The console perfoerms the following tasks.
	1. Create  a new object
	2. Retrieve an object forom a file
	3. Perform operations on the objects
	6. Destroy an object.

The python objectcs generated are stored in a JSON file through the process of serialisation and can be accessed using json module in python

STORAGE:
All the instances and classess are handled by the storage engine which is updated everytime new data is created
or generated by the command interpreter

The command interpreter just like the shell acts as the front end of the app for now, where thw user can interact with the backend development without manually running the perograms. 
This interpreter is limited to a number of commands that one defined solely for usage by the AirBnB clone website

ENVIRONMENT:

Programming Lamguage: Python
Operating system: Ubuntu WSL 22.04LTS
